Interactive Title Helper (WiP)

Interactive titles require a special interface for the player.
<br>VLC is the most popular player, so VLC shall be used.

## Best practice
...would probably to create a chapter file for the video file,
<br>which would allow instructing VLC to seek very accurately within in the file.

Seeking which is not chapter-based definetly has limited accuracy (HTTP requests; 1 second).
<br>However, the initial implementation is NOT to utilize chapter-based jumps.

## Code, data & License
The code for the displaying of interactive selections is [netflix-choices.py](netflix-choices.py).
<br>And the data for the titles is over at [interactive.py](interactive.py)
<br>The data contained in these files is subject to copyright laws.


Users are hereby notified that they are only granted a non-excluisve right
<br>to view (and use) this data for individual non-commercial purposes only.
<br>No rights to redistribute the data under free software terms. You may link back to this project for the data.
<br>The data was crafted manually... and not pulled from some internal database.

The code for displaying stuff is to be seen as licensed under MIT.
<br>(A copy of the license must NOT be included.)

# Piracy. - It's a crime.
Don't do it on behalf of the existance of this enhancement.
<br>Do improve the result of whatever crimes you already commited with this nifty thing.

Also, yes. - Netflix should be offering some license to download (some of?) content offline for good, sans DRM encryption.
<br>That's their choice not doing so. - That's THEIR CHOICE.

Again, the data is provided AS IS and released into the "public domain" with non-exclusive rights.
<br>Kinda like YouTube videos... they are also in the "public domain". - Anybody can view them.
<br>No special skills required. (Ads will of course show by default... without an active subscription to YouTube Premium.)

## Ad-blocking YouTube is "ad-revenue-piracy"
Ad-piracy. It's a crime. Just so you guys know.
Ad-blockers should be outlawed... in theory.
They should all be outlawed to the moon and back.
Think about it. You got a buisness and it runs on ads. (Facebook)
Such a form of buisness used to be profitable.
But no more. - Users are to blame. - Nobody but the leeches.

### Who deserves to be be blocked?
How do you know ad-blockers are run by the web mafia?
<br>The default needs to be only to disable ads for websites where ads are not deserved.
<br>The default is currently something else.

## If you're gonna use it... (OR JUST DON'T!) block ad revenue for tgx (OPINION)
tgx would be an exmaple. - That site deserves 0 of the ad revenue requested.
<br>The web notoriously hates regulation: If tgx shuts down, there'll soon be a new site in it's place that users will flock to.
<br>TGX is here to stay for now.
<br>But how long before they too can't withstand the legal pressure?

## Where to host illegal content?
Almost all countries have strict laws regarding properties, including intellectual properties.
<br>I sympathize with those who pirate, (ok, wait... hear me out)
<br>because I also would favor a world where the whole world jointly owns everything and no individual entity owns anything.
<br>Those who pirate either agree or are hippo-crites. (only if they are obese, otherwise they're just regular boring-ass* hypocrites)

\* the <a href="http://www.tcax.org/docs/ass-specs.htm" target="_blank">subtitle format</a> btw, that is. (Called you dirty-minded...)

## DJT
Donald Trump is known to be a hypocrite. He could very well be the "leader of the hypocrits"
<br>I wonder if he's pirated a movie. (technically none of my beeswax.)
<br>He's done other, worse crimes, so he probably has. (Although often enough the actual crimes were commited by his cronies, not by himself.)
<br>Looking good, btw -- I'm projecting a win for Kamala in 2024. ...

## <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/68362334/united-states-v-apple-inc/" target="_blank">[CourtListener]</a> DOJ is suing Apple. (That didn't ever happen while Trump was president.)
Even if Apple just pays 2$ (or 0.2% of their net worth... same thing), at least we will know what legal system in USA is capable of.
<br>Some might say "Whatever price tag Apple is forced to pay, they'll just raise the price of the iPhones/iPads/Macs/MacBooks accordingly."
<br>Yup, that would be nice. If people want the crappy tech, they should be forced to pay a crappy (overvalued) price.

### Cheap shot at Apple?
Yessir.

#### But don't you use Apple products too? - Doesn't that make you a hypocrite?
Yup, I sure do... and yes it does.
<br>Mainly Android/Windows...
<br>but I do also use a fairly old iPad Mini 4 (which I bought used) [almost on a daily basis].
<br>And recently acquired an older MacBook Air (also used when purchased)

<strong>Newsflash:</strong> Most people and entities on this planet are in fact hypocrites in some way, shape or form.

## Coming back to sites that don't deserve any ad revenue...
Are there other examples? Examples not within piracy? - Sure.
<br><strong>But that would probably depend on your political bend</strong>
<br>Fox News, if you're even giving them traffic.. which btw... you should NOT.
